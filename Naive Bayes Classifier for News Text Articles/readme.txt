Project 2
Naive Bayes Classifier for News Text Articles


The Project 2 is coded in python 3. 
I have tried running on Jupyter Notebook and Pycharm IDE.

Note:
please import os ,Counter, time ,nltk, Porter Stemmer, word_tokenize and numpy before executing the code.
Please download the dataset from the url(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-11/www/naive-bayes.html)
Please upload the dataset as zip and unzip it onto the same folder as Jupyter Notebook is present.

This project requires Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook to be installed.
Jupyter Notebook:
1) Run command: CTRL + ENTER on the selected cell.
2) when you run ML_A2_NB.ipynb it shows the accuracy, the error percentage and execution time as the output for the testing Data.
